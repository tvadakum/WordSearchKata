# WordSearchKata
For Pillar Tech Industry X.0 Kata
Included are two test files - default.txt and defaul2.txt - one is a 15x15 word search included in the description of the problem, the other is a 25x25 word search.
Included are 3 classes - one for a data struct used in the solution, the other for the main program, and the last for JUnit 4 test cases.
I was having trouble generalizing the path names in KataTester.java - those may need to be adjusted based off where this project is saved (lines 12 & 24)
Program can be run by Eclipse import (Right click package explorer > import > Projects from git) or by compiling via command line ( javac chartuple.java KataTester.java WordSearchKata.java TestRunner.java) and then java TestRunner. Make sure you have the JUnit repositories set up correctly on your environment.
